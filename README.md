# Machine learning with Python 
## Machine learning paradigms:
* Reinforcement learning
    * Open-gym environments
    * Custom setup
* Supervised learning
    * Classification
    * Regression
* Unsupervised learning 
    * Clustering
    * Anomaly-detection
    
- Use-Cases:
    - Image recognition and classification (e.g. Face recognition )
    - Natural language processing (e.g. Speech recognition, TTS )
    - Anomaly detection (e.g. Network attacks )
    - Robotics (e.g. Learning movements )
    - Stock prediction
    - ...
